## Introduction ℹ️

Welcome to the Jackpot Game Project, a PHP exercise designed to enhance your coding skills! 🚀



## Objective 🎯

In this project, the goal is to develop a fully functional Jackpot Game in PHP.

### Jackpot 

1. Create a program that displays three random fruit images, which change each time the page is refreshed.
2. Extend the previous program by adding a coin counter that can be increased using a form button.

Winning Conditions:
- One cherry: win one coin.
- Two cherries: win four coins.
- Three cherries: win ten coins.
- Two identical non-cherry fruits: win two coins.
- Three identical non-cherry fruits: win five coins.
